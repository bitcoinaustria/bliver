# BLiver System

This whole system is an ecosystem for paying delivered physical goods
via [Bitcoin][btc] with escrow.

The key idea is to package the partial Bitcoin transaction for releasing
the funds to the sender in the form of a [QR Code][qr]. This transaction
is completed by the receiver on delivery (and observed by the deliverer)
or a trusted third party.
